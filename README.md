E-Commerce Customer Behavior Analysis — Data Visualization in Python
This project explores and visualizes customer behavior patterns using an e-commerce dataset sourced from Kaggle. The goal was to extract business insights through powerful and interactive Python visualizations.

Dataset
Source: Kaggle
File used: ecommerce_customer_data_custom_ratios.csv

Project Objectives
The visualizations cover key questions such as:

How do total monthly sales vary over time?

What is the age distribution of customers by payment method?

Which product categories have the most returns?

Are there gender-based preferences in product categories?

What is the overall age distribution of customers?

What are the correlations between numeric features (e.g., purchase amount, age)?

How do total purchase amounts vary across the top 5 product categories?

How does total spending change daily over time?

Which product categories dominate across different payment methods?

What product categories are preferred by different age groups?
